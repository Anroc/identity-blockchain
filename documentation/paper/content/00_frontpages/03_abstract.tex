\label{cha:abstract}

In this thesis, we show an innovative approach to manage your own digital identity in the context
of the newly released GDPR. Compared with other blockchain-based solutions uPort, MedRec and Hawk,
this approach fulfills the all the required aspects of the GDPR, solves bottlenecks and critical
trains of thought.
In addition it provides a thorough look into the implementation and its reasonings.
