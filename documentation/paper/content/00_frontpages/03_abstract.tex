In this thesis, we show an innovative approach to manage your own digital identity in the context
of the newly released GDPR using blockchain for transparency of ownership of data.
Compared with other blockchain-based solutions uPort, MedRec and Hawk,
this approach is GDPR compliant as no personal information is stored in the blockchain, solves bottlenecks and critical
trains of thought.
It is self-sovereign by storing all identity oinformation of users and routing each request for population, evaluation and
changing of claims to the user.
In addition it provides a thorough look into the implementation of a prototype, its reasonings, examines challanges
how to establish and maintain trust in the system and how to maintain the blockchain's transparency properties in a
senseful way without exposing any identity information.
