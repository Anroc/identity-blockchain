\projectName{} is a proposed solution to the GDPR regulations that will restrict the process how companies are handling personal identity information. Especially the right to be forgotten is a big challenge when dealing with blockchain based systems, since blockchains are designed to be tramper proof. While related work is failing to provide support for this upcoming law, our prototype uses a combination of off- and on-blockchain communication to be GDPR compliant. With the pessimistic assumption in mind that cryptographic hashes or even strong encryption could be broken in near future, we implemented a system completely independent of any identity information in the blockchain. To maintain the transparency, that typically is a core feature of  distributed, public blockchain technologies, we are publishing transaction between provider and users to the blockchain. Thous transactions are organized in smart contracts that the ethereum network is providing us. 

With \projectName{} we build a overlay network based the decentralized ethereum network to populate identity meta information trough the blockchain. In that way our system remains transparent, so that each user knows who is holding which information about him. The user itself is the centralized entity thats summarizes all his identity attributes, while separated provider only save a subset of his information. Each sharing, changing or evaluation of his identity related data, is routed to the user so that he needs to provide his explicit approval for an action before proceeding, which makes our system self-sovereign.

However, while designing and implementing \projectName{} we needed to face many challenges and often had to acknowledge that our choices of technologies, implementing or designing were not perfectly fitting its purpose. We will summarize and examine the biggest issues in a critical review.

\subsection{Critical Review}
 
\textbf{Centralized trusted system vs decentralized untrusted system}

\noindent To fully understand the main issue with a centralized trusted system, we need to know how trust is established in such systems. Trust is predefined and relies heavily on that one, single component that handles all the data processing, forwarding or validating. However, the big advantages Ethereum or Bitcoin comes with, and what makes them so powerful, is decentralization.  Here trust needs to be established in the system itself rather then single components, by mutually validating each work done.  This system need to be as transparent as possible since otherwise we could not monitor other participants to notice malicious activities. Building an identity management system, however, enforces a very high level of confidentiality since we are dealing with personal information that need to be protected from any adversary. This both facts are somewhat contractible. It is clear that to advocate one, we need to make compromises with the other. 

Since we can not make compromises regarding the security handling of personal information, we need to make compromises with the transparency and how trust is organized. Reviewing our proposed solution we made clear trade-offs regarding the usage and decentralization of the blockchain. However, it is the current state of the art to deal with this balance between trusted and untrusted nodes. It was further complicated by the GDPR requirements that pushed us more to the centralized, trusted solution. 

\textbf{Ethereum blockchain}

\noindent Reviewing our system, the Ethereum network as our blockchain foundation was not the right choice. Solidity, the scripting language to program smart contracts in Ethereum, is not yet fully developed and was lacking library and native support. While we still managed to find workable solutions for each problem, the information amount we needed to store in the blockchain continued growing. Since it was not one of our design goals to be as space efficient as possible, we noticed that this solution was not feasible regarding operation costs. Each transaction against the ethereum network comes with the cost transaction fees and deploying smart contracts isnâ€™t cheap. So we are facing to fundamental design problems: First how to get the user bootstrapped with money and second, how to continually generating money to keep interacting with the system.

We could solve this issue, by eliminating the kind of renumeration of miners. MedRec \cite{azaria2016medrec}, for example, used the transferred information itself as renumeration, by anonymizeing the medical records and providing them to the miner so that they can use them for research purpose. We could think about a similar approach by blinding user attributes and providing them for demographic or social analyzes. However, the user and miner have to agree on this renumeration. 

Further Ethereum may not be the right choice. There are other blockchain technologies that are also especially designed for identity management. We could also think about implementing an own adaptation of a blockchain to make it fit out needs.
