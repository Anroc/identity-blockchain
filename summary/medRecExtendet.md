# MedRec

### Motivation

* unify patient access (clear and easy) to health data 
across providers and treatment sites
    * first step in improving ability to make smart decisions
* facilitate patient-initiated data-sharing
    * patients could authorize 3rd party to view their information
* anonymized, aggregated "big data"
    * incentive system for healthcare industry stakeholders
    * provide data as mining rewards and secure via Proof of Work
    
### Goal

* no novel EHR system
* use already existent data structures 
(e.g. string queries, protocols)
    * achieved with database gatekeeper module
* overall a backend system design


### Why Blockchain

* transaction based state-machine
* Ethereum is first attempt of full implementation of this idea
    * Turing-complete instruction set
        * important property for EHR management
    * smart contracts contain metadata about ownership, permissions,
    and data integrity

### Why Ethereum

* MedRec is a fork of ethereum
* a privatized, small-scale blockchain with extensive APIs built
on top
* problem because of "hard" forks
